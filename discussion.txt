Discussion Question 1

There is only one store per loop iteration, so we should see store misses fairly 
rarely thanks to other loop activity (notably nops, etc.)

Indeed, upon log inspection, we can see that we only have a store miss about 
once every 300 macine cycles.

Discussion Question 2

As expected, IPCs for benchmark programs were not different.

IPCs for Exercise 1

benchmark | IPC
----------------
median    | 0.46
multiply  | 0.61
qsort     | 0.32
tower     | 0.27
vvadd     | 0.47
